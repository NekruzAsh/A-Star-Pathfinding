# What I learned 
* Heuristic Functions: Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the search algorithm
* Pathfinding: Understanding a pathfinding algorithm that is commonly used in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
* Data Structures: Implementing Priority Queue and dictionaries for organizing and managing data

## How to use
* Simply download the program and launch it from VSCode or (IDE of choice)
* Click to place the first node on the grid and the second click to place the target node
* Third click is used to place as many obstacles as you want anywhere on the grid
* Hit the spacebar to start the program and watch the algorithm do its work
* After it finishes you can hit C to clear the grid or hold Right Mouse button to clear manually
